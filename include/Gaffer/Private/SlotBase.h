// SlotBase forms the core of the Gaffer::Signals system, providing a data
// structure designed for the storage of the slots connected to a signal. It is
// designed to meet several requirements :
//
// - Constant time insertion and removal of slots.
// - Shared ownership, so Connection can be used to track slots independently of
//   the Signal, and connections can continue to exist beyond the lifetime of
//   the signal and vice-versa.
// - Robustness to interesting situations such as self-disconnecting slots and
//   slots that cause the signal itself to be deleted.
// - Minimal storage requirements among the various Signals components.
//
// To meet these requirements, SlotBase objects are reference counted and form a
// doubly linked list with a few specific features :
//
// - The next slot is referenced by `intrusive_ptr`. This allows Signal to
//   maintain the lifetime of the slots purely by holding a single pointer to
//   the first slot, and also allows Connection to share ownership via it's own
//   `intrusive_ptr`.
// - The `previous` field doesn't point to the previous _slot_, but instead to
//   its `SlotBase::next` field. This allows the first slot to point back
//   directly to `Signal::m_firstSlot`, meaning we can remove a slot from the
//   list without needing access to a Signal object.
// - Disconnected slots keep a valid `next` pointer, so that SlotCallIterator
//   can continue iteration even if a slot disconnects itself when called.

	//   intended to be threadsafe and a non-atomic count yields significantly
	//   improved performance, particularly in
	//   `SignalsTest.testCallPerformance()`.
