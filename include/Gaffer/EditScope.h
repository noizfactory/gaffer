/// EditScopes and Tools
/// ====================
///
/// Tools that affect change by modifying nodes/plugs in the Node Graph
/// should use the following logic to determine their edit target:
///
///  - If no EditScope has been selected, use the last (closest) upstream
///    target.
///
///  - If an EditScope has been selected, prefer existing targets inside
///    the EditScope over using the EditScopeAlgo to acquire a new target.
///
///  - If an EditScope has been selected, but is upstream of another target
///    either error (if overrides preclude editing), or allow editing with
///    a suitable warning identifying the last downstream target.
///
///  - If an EditScope has been selected but is not in the scene history,
///    error.
