  # I wasn't sure how to make sure that a range of possible ColorSpace's would all be handled correctly
  # by our GPU path, so I made a single "worst possible ColorSpace".  It contains a sequence of a bunch of
  # 1D luts, 3D luts, matrices, CDL, and gamma adjustments, several of which contain unreasonably high
  # frequency variation, which will exaggerate any errors.
  #
  # With the new OCIO2 GPU path, it is now possible to get a perfect match to the CPU path, if you make 2
  # modifications:
  #  * switch ImageGadget to use INTENSITY32F instead of INTENSITY16F for image tiles
  #  * switch pandemoniumBig.cube to use tetrahedral interpolation.  OCIO itself has a loss of precision when
  #    using linear interpolation of 3D luts on the GPU, because it uses the default GPU 3D texture filter,
  #    which is approximate
